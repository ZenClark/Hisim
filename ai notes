Every general should have either a random or preset disposition for all other generals.
Dispositon based on -100 to 100 scale. Below zero denotes aggressive behavior for rulers.

A disposition for current or allied territories should be present. Basic AI should aim for
increasing the loyalty of the territory, and improving their own dispositon towards it.

A high disposition towards the territory will encourage benifitial behavior, and a low
disposition will encourage neglect.

Every choice of action should be based on both a disposition, and a variable mood. A percentage
calculated between the current mood and a leveling disposition should define priorities.

Disposition/Mood; The higher the value, the higher the priority. A higher disposition will increase
the weight of the mood.
